# CODES IN MOTION

This project is a work in collaboration with [Aline Martinez](http://alinemartinez.io/) to demonstrate the use of her CODES IN MOTION work.
A garment worn sends realtime data to a processing sketch, to which various people can connect to create a participateive sketch.
Some parameters of the sketch are controlled by the garment bearer's movements.
